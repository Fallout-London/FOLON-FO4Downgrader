After download each depot manually you can move the contents of each subfolder in this directory into your Fallout 4 installation folder, ensuring you overwrite all files in the destination folder

_Note 1: The location of your ‘steamapps/content’ folder may vary if your Steam install isn’t in the default location or you’re using an Operating System other than Windows
Note 2: You can open up your Fallout 4 installation folder easily in Steam by right-clicking on Fallout 4 in your Steam Library and then selecting Manage > Browse Local Files:_

C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/content/app_377160
```



If you want to block updates you additionally have set the following file to read only

_Note 1: The location of your ‘steamapps/appmanifest_377160.acf’ file may vary if the Steam Library Fallout 4 is installed to isn’t in the default location or you’re using an Operating System other than Windows:_

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\appmanifest_377160.acf
```

After doing all of this you should remove Creation Club content by removing every file inside 'steamapps/common/Fallout 4/Data' with cc in the start
