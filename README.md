# FOLON's Fallout 4 Downgrader

If you do not trust it there's a [document Here](./Manually.md) which guides you through downgrading manually.

On linux This requires qt and curl to be installed, how it is installed depends on your distro, but it should work on windows out of the box.

To run this [get a binary from Releases](https://github.com/Fallout-London/FOLON-FO4Downgrader/releases/latest) for windows or run the following on Linux.

```
git clone https://github.com/Fallout-London/FOLON-FO4Downgrader.git && cd FOLON-FO4Downgrader && chmod +x Run.sh && ./Run.sh
```

## To build
Read the [build document](./build.md)

## Archival
Due to the launch of FOLON being over and the main developer being busy with college this repo is being archived, this dosen't mean that the project is abandoned but just that it isn't recieving new feature updates and only possible security patches down the line.
